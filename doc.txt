Hi ub1stembroidery, I reviewed your brief and am interested in working on this project.  I see you include a website reference customink.com and I reviewed all features. yeah, it is possible to make the same UI and features for me. 

don't worry I'm not a Shopify developer. I am a full stack, MERN stack, and Next.js developer. I don't know do you have enough tech knowledge but don't worry will describe all things. Next.js is the latest and SEO-friendly React framework. so to grow your business need SEO (search engine optimization) and we can do it using Nex.js Technology better way. I will develop the backend using Javascript and Node.js framework. reason to choose Node.js and Javascript because its work  both way anync and sync on backend . so using Node.js we can make very faster our website and ensure user experience and load time . 


i see you included delivery time within Dec 21, 2023 . its 1 mounth but i will develop this website
